## API Aggregation Service (.NET 8)

This project is an **API Aggregation Service** built with **ASP.NET Core (.NET 8)**.  
It fetches and combines data from multiple external APIs (comments, recipes, weather), stores it in a local database, caches the results, and exposes a single unified API endpoint to access the aggregated data 
and another endpoint that previews the statistics of the external APIs.

There is also a background job that detects anomalies in the external api calls response time, comparing with the average time

In the branch feature/jwt, there are some extra functionalities
